For #1, all of the builds in the wait_for_qe2 step were already promoted to the next step, so there was nothing to promote.  You'll have to kick off new builds manually in the jenkins instance to get builds that can be promoted.

For #2, I'm confused.  I had always assumed that Touchstone was for automated testing.  Are teams putting manual test results in a touchstone run and including that as part of the automated results?
In this scenario that you describe, I think it would be ideal to set up a track that had a couple different qe environments, one that we could be continually running automated tests against, deploying to the environment when there were changes, and another environment that could be used for manual testing.  Manual testers could "pull" builds into the environment when they were ready to test them (the pull would simply be an assertion against a "wait_for_*" step which would trigger a deploy step to the given environment).  They could only pull the builds in if they had passed the automated tests in the previous environment.

What do you think?  I think this would be a lot easier than trying to construct a locking system.  For many things the separate environment could simply be an additional server or two in the existing environment, kind of like what qe1-a is.

BTW, how long does it usually take to run the suite of automated tests?  Is that something that could be done in a sane amount of time (like < 15 minutes) so that we didn't put a huge bottleneck in the manual testing process?

Thanks,
